        <h2>A little bit more about me</h2>
        <p>From the beginning of my life, I knew I did not know what to do with my life. After I decided to learn something new, I decide to code and to see what other
            opportunities I could see. Now here I am learning how to program and become a better human.

        <p>I like to code since I decided to learn how to program. I started doing Python, then I fall in love with front-end development</p>

        <img src="images/computer.jpg" alt="computer">
        <p>I like to get to know more about computers and really get to know what is inside. I first I tried to do IT because I knew the anatomy of the computer it will keep me 
            satisfying, however I understood that what it really satisfies me is speaking with the computer. Coding is telling the computer what to do and that
            makes you to have some power.

        <h2 class = "japanese">I like Japanese</h2>
        <img src="images/japan.jpg" alt="japan">
        <p>do not get me started with Japanese. In my last three years I have been learning Japanese and so far I don't regret the decision to keep learning this language.
            Yes it is hard but really satisfying and I cannot highlight more how much happiness this language bring me. I totally recommend it.

        <p>Workout is a lifesaver. In fact, it has been great since I can really be myself in my own skin. I lost 130 lbs and I feel great. I still want to keep improving
            and be better at myself.
